# Knight's Tour

This repo shows my solutions to the [Knight's tour problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour)
(With condition that the starting point = left upper corner)

1- my-knights-tour-Backtracking.py shows the solution using Backtracking method.  
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME in my local is > 26 seconds.

2- my-knights-tour-Warnsdorffs-rule.py shows the solution using Warnsdorff's rule.  
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME in my local is < 0.002 seconds.

Warnsdorff's algorithm improves the performance at least by 13000 times :)
Plus, the performance is same if the starting point = many of other positions.
