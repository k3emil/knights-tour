# Knight's Tour

This repo shows my solutions to the [Knight's tour problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour)

1- my-knights-tour-Backtracking.py shows the solution using Backtracking method

TOTAL EXECUTION TIME is more than 32 seconds (starting point is left upper corner)

2- my-knights-tour-Warnsdorffs-rule.py shows the solution using Warnsdorff's method.

TOTAL EXECUTION TIME is less than 0.002 seconds

Warnsdorff's algorithm improves the performance by more than 16000 times with fewer lines :)  
Plus, it works fast no matter which position is the starting point !!
